# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis in finance involves analyzing earnings reports, financial news, analyst statements, and stock market discussions to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since financial language is different from general text, traditional sentiment models often fail to capture domain-specific nuances.

FinBERT, a fine-tuned version of BERT for finance, helps overcome this by providing accurate sentiment classification on financial texts. It has been trained on financial datasets, making it effective for tasks like market trend prediction, risk assessment, and investor sentiment analysis.
